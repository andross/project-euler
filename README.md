### Less math heavy problems

These are more about programming skills, and less about math.

* 54 -- Compare poker hands. A good opportunity for some test-driven development.
* 65 -- Simple calculations with big rational numbers.
* 165 -- Find all intersection points between 5000 line segments. Good OOP exercise.
